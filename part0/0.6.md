        participant browser
        participant server

        browser->>server: POST new_note_spa to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
        activate server

        Note right of browser: The browser posts the user input "new_note_spa" to server.
        Note right of browser: It's posted as JSON data containing both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date).

        server-->>browser: HTTP Status Code 201 Created
        deactivate server

        Note right of browser: The server does not ask for a redirect, the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests.
```
How the SPA version works compared to older version:
The browser does not traditionally send the form data, but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server.
This code fetches the form element from the page and registers an event handler.
This handler prevents the default handling of form's submit which would be a new GET request.
Then the handler adds a new note to the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
